# Easy Store

## Description of the Project

This is an online shopping platform that aims to make shopping easier by allowing to filter products based on multiple metrics and more secure by requiring authentication to add, alter or delete products.


## User Stories

- As a shopper, I want to browse products by categories so that I can easily find items Iâ€™m interested in.

- As a shopper, I want to add products to my shopping cart so that I can purchase them later.

- As a shopper, I want to view, update, and clear my shopping cart so that I can prepare for checkout.

- As a shopper, I want to place an order so that I can purchase items in my cart.

- As an admin, I want to add, update, or delete products so that I can manage the store inventory.

- As an admin, I want to view all orders so that I can monitor sales and manage fulfillment.

- As a developer, I want to use RESTful endpoints so that I can integrate the backend with the frontend application.

- As a QA engineer, I want to test user registration functionality to ensure it works as expected
